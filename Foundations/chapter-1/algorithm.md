# Algorithm
### What is algorithm?
### Is the study of algorithm worthwhile?
### Role of algorithm in technology.

Till today I have learned that algorithm is the steps to solve computational problem.


Algorithm is the step wise procedure that transform given input to output. Computer Programs
use different algorithm in different programming languages to solve problems. We can measure
algorithm or determine how efficient an algorithm (mostly we care about time and
space efficiency) with respect to input size. 

Time Complexity of algorithm from efficient to inefficient in big O's notation
O(1) ------------------------> most efficient
O(log(n))
O(n)
O(n*log(n))
O(n^2)
O(n^3)
O(2^n) -----------------------> least efficient
